# riverpod_firebase_chat

A new Flutter project.

## A Comprehensive Description

## Setup Instructions

## Any other relevant information that aids in understanding and navigating your project.

## Running the project with Firebase

To use this project with Firebase, follow these steps:

- Create a new project with the Firebase console
- Enable Firebase Authentication, along with the Email/Password Authentication Sign-in provider in the Firebase Console (Authentication > Sign-in method > Email/Password > Edit > Enable > Save)
- Enable Cloud Firestore (And Watch out for the Security Rules!)

Then, follow one of the two approaches below. ðŸ‘‡

### 1. Using the CLI

Make sure you have the Firebase CLI and [FlutterFire CLI](https://pub.dev/packages/flutterfire_cli) installed.

Then run this on the terminal from the root of this project:

- Run `firebase login` so you have access to the Firebase project you have created
- Run `flutterfire configure` and follow all the steps

For more info, follow this guide:

- [How to add Firebase to a Flutter app with FlutterFire CLI](https://codewithandrea.com/articles/flutter-firebase-flutterfire-cli/)

### 2. Manual way (not recommended)

If you don't want to use FlutterFire CLI, follow these steps instead:

- Register separate iOS, Android, and web apps in the Firebase project settings.
- On Android, use `com.example.starter_architecture_flutter_firebase` as the package name.
- then, [download and copy](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup#configure_an_android_app) `google-services.json` into `android/app`.
- On iOS, use `com.example.starterArchitectureFlutterFirebase` as the bundle ID.
- then, [download and copy](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup#configure_an_ios_app) `GoogleService-Info.plist` into `iOS/Runner`, and add it to the Runner target in Xcode.
